<a href=https://shiba-sensei.web.app/>Play Game!</a>

Shiba Sensei is a infinite puzzle game built w/ vanilla JS/HTML/CSS.
<br>It uses two API's: shibe.online, which grabs a random image of a shibe inu,
<br>and the Web Audio API, for sound effects. More specifically, it uses the Howler.js
<br>library and some free mp3's from SoundBible.com, so remember to turn your sound on!

This is what a solved image looks like:
